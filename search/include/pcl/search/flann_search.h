      * It is able to wrap any FLANN index type, e.g. the kd tree as well as indices for high-dimensional
      * searches and intended as a more powerful and cleaner successor to KdTreeFlann.
      * THIS CODE IS NOT DONE YET! IT CONTAINS KNOWN UNHANDLED FAILURE CASES, AND IS CURRENTLY TO BE
      * CONSIDERED WORK-IN-PROGRESS!
      * \note this class depends on an un-released change in FLANN git, so it is not built by default.
