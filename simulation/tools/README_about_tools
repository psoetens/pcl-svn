1. sim_viewer.cpp
purpose: visualize within VTK environment - almost same as PCL viewer
status : use the mouse to drive around, and 'v' to capture a cloud. reads vtk and obj. visualizes vtk and makes pcd of obj. conflict between RL and VTK means doesnt visualize properly
range_pcd_viewer.cpp

2. sim_terminal_demo.cpp
purpose: simple app to demo speed and api to pcl_simulation
status : reads obj, make a series of 640x480 simulated point clouds and exits

3. sim_test_performance.cpp
purpose: GLUT/GLEW viewer used by Hordur to test GLSL optimizations
status : reads obj, creates window, use keyboard to drive around environment
range_performance_test.cpp

4. sim_test_simple
purpose: similar code to #3 but only has a single 640x480 window, but operates as #1
status : reads obj, creates window, use keyboard to drive around environment
range_test_v2.cpp

Dead Versions:
range_viewer.cpp - certain not useful. Hordur created this as barebones vtk viewer, not useful
range_viewer_v2.cpp - uses the above, but never really worked properly.
range_test.cpp - out of date demo program (used old style PointCloudModel)
