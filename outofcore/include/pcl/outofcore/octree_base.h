   *  \brief This code defines the octree used for point storage at Urban Robotics. 
   *
   *  \note Code was adapted from the Urban Robotics out of core octree implementation. 
   *  Contact Jacob Schloss <jacob.schloss@urbanrobotics.net> with any questions. 
   *  http://www.urbanrobotics.net/
   *
   *  The primary purpose of this class is an interface to the
   *  recursive traversal (recursion handled by \ref octree_base_node) of the
   *  in-memory/top-level octree structure. The metadata in each node
   *  can be loaded entirely into main memory, and the tree traversed
   *  recursively in this state. This class provides an the interface
   *  for: 
   *               -# Point/Region INSERTION methods 
   *               -# Frustrum/box/region REQUESTS/QUERIES 
   *               -# Parameterization of compression, resolution, container type, etc...
   *
   *
   *  \todo downsampling of queries
   *  \todo downsampling of octree during construction (or leave that to the user's own preprocessing)
   *  \todo parameterize compression 
   *  \todo parameterize container type (template?)
   *  \todo adjust for varying densities at different LODs
   *  \todo Re-implement buildLOD for PointCloud2 / pcd files
   *  \todo Add support for an array of input clouds or locations of pcd files on disk
   *  \todo clean up access specifiers to streamline public interface
   *  \todo add PCL macro into templated hpp files
