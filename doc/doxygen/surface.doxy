  \section secSurfacePresentation Overview

The <b>pcl_surface</b> library deals with reconstructing the original
surfaces from 3D scans.  Depending on the task at hand, this can be for
example the hull, a mesh representation or a smoothed/resampled surface with
normals.

Smoothing and resampling can be important if the cloud is noisy, or if it is
composed of multiple scans that are not aligned perfectly.  The complexity
of the surface estimation can be adjusted, and normals can be estimated in
the same step if needed.

Meshing is a general way to create a surface out of points, and currently
there are two algorithms provided: a very fast triangulation of the original
points, and a slower meshing that does smoothing and hole filling as well.
